And I live my life at the intersection of technology, underwater exploration, and the pulsating rhythms of techno music. My journey is a harmonious blend of programming, scuba diving adventures, deep-seated passion for ocean conservation and electronic music. Here, you'll find mainly four types of content:

1. 👨‍💻 **Software:** I like to build and experiment with the technologies I like: Containers, compilers, distributed systems, eBPF, programming languages, internals, etc. In this section, I publish only technical content about software.

2. 🐋 **Diving and ocean conservation:** I publish occasionally the journey of my dives. Join me in the fight to protect our oceans.

3. 💡 **Misc:** In the section "Misc" I write my thoughts, notes, quotes or whatever about software and humanity. Just random opinions. I'm native Spanish speaker, only the content there will be in Spanish.

4. 🎶 **Techno Music:** A curated list of tracks that I like. Feel the groove!
