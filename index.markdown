And I live my life at the intersection of technology, underwater exploration, and the pulsating rhythms of techno music. Here I publish ocassionally about:

1. 👨‍💻 **Software:** I experiment with the technologies I like. My main focus is profiling, performance and observability. However, from time to time, I could write about other topics like containers, compilers, distributed systems, programming languages and all about software internals.

2. 🐋 **Diving and ocean conservation:** Since I started to dive back in 2006, I have become a direct witness to how we are killing the sea with our consumption practices. I'm fully involved in Ocean conservation efforts through storytelling and audiovisual and educational content . In this section, I document all this journey.

3. 💡 **Misc:** In the section "Misc" I write my thoughts, notes, quotes or whatever about software and humanity. Just random opinions. I'm native Spanish speaker, only the content there will be in Spanish.

4. 🎶 **Techno Music:** A curated list of tracks that I like. Feel the groove!
